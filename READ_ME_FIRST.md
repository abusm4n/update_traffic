## Reading Recommendations

**If you have 5 minutes**:
→ REVISION_SUMMARY.md

**If you have 20 minutes**:
→ REVISION_SUMMARY.md + GETTING_STARTED.md

**If you have 1 hour**:
→ REVISION_SUMMARY.md + PROJECT_ANALYSIS_REVISED.md sections 1-3

**If you have 2 hours**:
→ All documentation + Review Experiment 1 notebook

**If you have 4 hours**:
→ All documentation + Run Experiment 1 + Read paper's Section 4-5

## Implementation Checklist

Use this to track your progress:

```
Setup & Understanding
  ☐ Read REVISION_SUMMARY.md
  ☐ Read GETTING_STARTED.md
  ☐ Read PROJECT_ANALYSIS_REVISED.md section 1-3
  ☐ Run explore_data.sh to see available data

Experiment 1 (Entropy Baselines)
  ☐ Set up Python environment
  ☐ Install dependencies
  ☐ Run Jupyter notebook OR Python script
  ☐ Review outputs in analysis_output/

Experiment 2 (Cipher Analysis)
  ☐ Design implementation
  ☐ Write cipher aggregation code
  ☐ Compute device security scores
  ☐ Generate visualizations
  ☐ Statistical testing

Experiment 3 (Plaintext Coverage)
  ☐ Develop classification method
  ☐ Validate against known samples
  ☐ Estimate false positive/negative rates
  ☐ Generate coverage reports

Continue with Experiments 4-8...

## Next Action

**Your next step**: Pick ONE of these

1. **Quick start** (15 min): `REVISION_SUMMARY.md` → Run `explore_data.sh`

2. **Foundation** (30 min): `REVISION_SUMMARY.md` → `GETTING_STARTED.md` → Run Experiment 1

3. **Deep dive** (90 min): Read all documentation → Understand Experiment 2 design → Plan implementation

**Recommendation**: Start with option 2 - gives you quick win (Exp 1 running) + understanding

## Questions?

Each document has:
- **Context** (what are we doing & why?)
- **Details** (how to do it)
- **Limitations** (what we can't do)
- **Next steps** (what to do when done)

If something is unclear, check the relevant document first.
